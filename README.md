# SpyRobo_IoT-Project
The remote-controlled robot car is a cutting-edge device built using the ESP32 Cam module, designed to be controlled via the ESP32 Cam itself. This innovative system enables users to remotely operate the robot car's movements using the ESP32 Cam's interface. Equipped with powerful motors and a real-time video streaming capability, the robot car offers a seamless and immersive experience. Whether exploring indoor environments or conducting surveillance tasks, this remote-controlled robot car provides an intuitive solution that combines the functionality of the ESP32 Cam with the mobility of a robot vehicle.
# Project features
## Wi-Fi:
The robot will be controlled via Wi-Fi using your ESP32-CAM
## Web-based Interface:
We’ve created a web-based interface to control the robot, that can be accessed in any device inside your local network. The web page also shows a video streaming of what the robot “sees”.
## Robot Controls
The web server has 5 controls: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop. The robot moves as long as you’re pressing the buttons. When you release any button, the robot stops
# Components/parts used:
## For this project, we’ve used the following parts:
1. ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker
2. L298N Motor driver: To control the motor through ESP32-CAM
3. 2 WHEELER ROBOT CHASIS KIT
4. 4 Battery cells(used in series) to provide total 6v.
5. Jumper Wires
